# Student-Enrollment-System
This is an SQL script that defines the database structure and sample data for a simple student enrollment system.

This SQL project creates the backend database for a **Student Enrollment System**.

Here's a quick brief:
* **Purpose:** To store and organize all the information needed for a school to manage its students, courses, and grades.
* **Key Components (Tables):**
    * `students`: Holds student profile information (name, email, etc.).
    * `courses`: Lists the available courses (like 'DBMS' or 'OOP').
    * `instructors`: Stores information about the teachers.
    * `enrollment`: Connects students to the courses they are taking.
    * `studentsgrades`: Records the grades students receive in each course.
* **Includes:** The script not only **builds the tables** but also **adds sample data** (a few students, courses, and grades) so the database isn't empty.
